                          is responsible for introducing new coins into the existing circulating supply and is one of the key elements that allow cryptocurrencies to work as a peer-to-peer decentralized network, without the need for a third party central authority.   It is also the process in which transactions between users are verified and added to the blockchain public ledger.

                          is a list of data records that works as a decentralized digital ledger. The data is organized into blocks, which are chronologically arranged and secured by cryptography.

                      'What\'s less discussed is its environmental impact. Let\'s put the energy consumption of the Bitcoin Network into perspective by comparing it to relatable quantities.',

                      'However is more energy being consumed inherently bad for the environment?  Supporters argue that as long as the mining farms use renewable energy, energy consumption is not an issue. However this argument has two flaws: Increase in renewable energy production will not be able to keep up with energy needed to maintain the network. And using the limited supply of renewable energy for mining will only allow Bitcoin miners to go green while forcing other industries to use fossil fuels ',

                        <p className='term-content'>
                          PoW algorithms only allow users to add transactions to the ledger if they have given a proof of computational ‘work’ completed. PoS algorithms work for systems where blocks are not ‘mined’ by solving a puzzle, but validated by validators that are selected by the network

                        <p className='term-content'>
                          Bitcoin consumes an immense amount of energy, but only makes up 80% of the market cap and is actually more energy efficient than a lot of its counterparts. This is because it uses a SHA-256 hash algorithm, which cryptocurrencies like Monero and Dogecoin do not support, rendering them magnitudes more energy intensive.
