                      `As did its price`,
                      `What's less discussed is its environmental impact. Here we put the energy consumption of the Bitcoin Network into perspective by comparing it to relatable quantities`,
                      `And comparing it to polluting industries`,
                      `And to a VISA transaction`,
                      `But why does bitcoin consume an enormous amount of energy? 

To add valid transactions to the ledger, volunteers have to find a solution to a computationally intensive puzzle based on a ‘hash function’ called SHA-256.

The total number of computations (hashes) per second being performed by all volunteers to solve the puzzle at any given time is known has hash rate.

Hash rate is directly related to the number and processing power of the computers being used to maintain the ledger and therefore indicates the total energy being consumed by the BTC network.

                      `However is more energy being consumed inherently bad for the environment?

Supporters argue that as long as the mining farms use renewable energy, energy consumption is not an issue. 

However this argument has two flaws: 

Increase in renewable energy production will not be able to keep up with energy needed to maintain the network

Using the limited supply of renewable energy for mining will only allow Bitcoin miners to go green while forcing other industries to use fossil fuels 
`,
`So what can we do about it?

Move away from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) Algorithms

PoW algorithms only allow users to add transactions to the ledger if they have given a proof of computational ‘work’ completed. 

PoS algorithms work for systems where blocks are not ‘mined’ by solving a puzzle, but validated by validators that are selected by the network. The likelihood of a validator being chosen to validate a block is proportional to the amount of the currency they own.

`So what can we do about it?

Apply lower bounds on consensus algorithm efficiency


Regulate Mining Farms

Some experts suggest levying a Carbon Tax on mining activity.

Some authorities, like those in Quebec, Canada have increased the cost of electricity for miners

                    It is based on publicly available ledger with a history of all the transactions.

                    Since no central system controls its value, and anyone can contribute to maintain the
