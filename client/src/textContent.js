                          is responsible for introducing new coins into the existing circulating supply and is one of the key elements that allow cryptocurrencies to work as a peer-to-peer decentralized network, without the need for a third party central authority.   It is also the process in which transactions between users are verified and added to the blockchain public ledger.

This is because it uses a SHA-256 hash algorithm, which cryptocurrencies like Monero and Dogecoin do not support, rendering them magnitudes more energy intensive.",
